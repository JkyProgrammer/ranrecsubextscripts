# Random Recursive Subdivision and Extrusion Scripts for Blender 2.80

It's basically what is says on the tin. Just make sure to install the two scripts as separate add-ons, and it should all work. Contact me if you have problems!

## subdiv-v2.py

Adds an item to the 'Add' menu which constructs a plane and then randomly, recursively splits it. The recursive depth, number of split attempts, and plane size are all adjustable.

## randomExtrude.py

Extrudes each individual face of an object a random distance. The maximum and minimum distances are adjustable, along with the scaling of these values.
